"""
Test Case 1: Basic SJF Scheduling

Purpose:
This test case verifies the basic working of the Shortest Job First
(Non-Preemptive) scheduling algorithm.

Description:
All processes arrive at the same time.
The CPU selects the process with the smallest burst time first.

Expected Behavior:
The scheduler compares burst times only.
The process with the shortest burst executes first.

Expected Gantt Chart Order:
P4 → P1 → P3 → P2

Importance:
Confirms correct shortest-job selection in SJF scheduling.
