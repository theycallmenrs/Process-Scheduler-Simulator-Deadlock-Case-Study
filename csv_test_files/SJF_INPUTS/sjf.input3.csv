"""
Test Case 3: CPU Idle Time Scenario

Purpose:
This test case verifies CPU behavior when no process is available.

Description:
The CPU remains idle until the first process arrives.
Once a process arrives, SJF scheduling begins.

Expected Behavior:
CPU is idle initially.
Processes are scheduled only after arrival.

Expected Gantt Chart Order:
Idle → P1 → P2 → P3

Importance:
Ensures correct handling of idle CPU time and avoids premature execution.
